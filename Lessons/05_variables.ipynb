    "## Variable Names \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can only have certain characters in their name to avoid confusion with Python syntax such as operators. There are a few rules to remember when you name your variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore (`_`) character (no numbers).\n",
    "1. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
    "1. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "The best thing to do is to name your variables descriptively, so that you know what they're used for. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "length = 100 \n",
    "tu.draw(length)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, it's handy to shorten variable names so you can go quicker:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l = 100\n",
    "tu.draw(l)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That can be confusing if it's not extremely obvious what the variable `l` is for. If in doubt, you can be as verbose as you like. The underscore `_` character means you can have very descriptive variable names. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "length_of_side = 100\n",
    "tu.draw(length_of_side)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What style you choose is up to you. Just remember, you are the programmer who is most likely to be confused by your code."
