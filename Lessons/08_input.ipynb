    "The `input()` function *returns* what the user typed to your program. We will talk a lot about return values later in the semester. When a function returns a value you have to *catch* that value into a variable. That's done using the assignment operator you learned in lesson 5. In this example the `input` function places what the user types into the variable `answer`. \n",
