    "## A Python Calculator \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the project is to perform the calculations you learned in Lesson 2 and display the results. The source of the calculations comes from prompting the user for input with the `input` function. The output of the program is HTML, which will be nicely formatted by Jupyter. The *algorithm* has three steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Ask the user for a number two times and store the numbers in variables `a` and `b`. \n",
    "  2. Use the `format` function or and `f-string` (your choice) to build HTML code. \n",
    "  3. Display the HTML code using the `HTML` Jupyter function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculator Output \n",
    "\n",
    "Your calculator should perform the following operations: \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Addition (`+`)\n",
    "  2. Subtraction (`-`)\n",
    "  3. Multiplication (`*`)\n",
    "  4. Division (`/`)\n",
    "  5. Modululs (`%`)\n",
    "  6. Less than (`<`)\n",
    "  7. Greater than (`>`)\n",
    "  8. Equal to (`==`)\n",
    "  \n",
    "For example, if a user enters the numbers `12` and `56` the program generates an HTML table that looks like this: \n",

    "| Operation | Result |\n",
    "| --- | --- | \n",
    "| 12.0 + 56.0 | 68.0 |\n",

    "| 12.0 * 56.0 | 672.0 | \n",

    "### HTML Tables \n",
    "\n",
    "You learned a little about HTML in class. Here's a link to a tutorial that will help you understand how to build HTML tables: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Your program must have a docstring \n",
    "  - Your program must generate HTML \n",
    "  - Your table must have a header row as shown in the example.\n",
    "  - You must perform all of the operations shown. \n",
    "    - I will test your code with random numbers, you must actually do the math! \n",
    "  - Your program must be submitted inside of this notebook.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Your HTML code should be inside of a Python variable. Kinda like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      output = \"\"\"<h1>Hello World</h1>\"\"\"\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - The `format()` function or the f-string are perfect for creating a string that mixes HTML and the content of variables in your program. \n",
    "  \n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      some_number = 43\n",
    "      output = f\"\"\"The number is <b>{some_number}</b>\"\"\"\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "  - The function shown below tells Jupyter to treat the `output` variable as HTML and display it nicely.\n",
    "  \n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      display(HTML(output))\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This code must be in your program after the docstring to make the `HTML` function available.\n",
    "  \n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      from IPython.core.display import HTML \n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      \n",
    "      "
